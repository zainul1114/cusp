# JupyterLab
**JupyterLab** is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter offering all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (*notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.*) in a flexible and a more powerful user interface. The basic idea of the Jupyter Lab is to bring all the building blocks that are in the classic notebook, plus some new stuff, under one roof. [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
